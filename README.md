# Daily Gratitude - front-end

The front-end of the Daily Gratitude project uses vanilla JavaScript and Bootstrap components. 

## Functionality 
Currently, users are able to write gratitude posts and upvote each others'. Votes are persisted using the `daily-gratitude-back-end` Rails API. 

## Installation
To use this app locally, download this repo along with the back-end server. When the server is running, launch the `index.html` file to use the site.
